  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 27, 2025</p>

  <p>
    Aurelia Labs (“we”, “our”, or “us”) provides a live speech and grammar
    correction app that allows users to speak in their target language and
    receive AI-assisted corrections. We are committed to protecting your
    privacy and being transparent about how your data is used.
  </p>
